# Player widget

This is a podcast player project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## The stack

I tried to keep this project as simple as possible, so the stack that I've used is failry simple.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

Almost all the code resides in the `index.tsx` page. Since the layout is straight forward, I've used Tailwind like a prototype tool, to be as efficient as possible. Whenever I get a complicated style, such as linear gradient, I've used the `global.css` file. Again, no need for SCSS here since it's a fairly simple project.

The `Button` component has been created, just to make it a bit more reusable, and for the sake of creating a component :D
